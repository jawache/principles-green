# Electricity

**Build applications that are energy efficient.**

Most electricity is still produced through the burning of fossil fuels and is responsible for [49% of the carbon emitted](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions) into the atmosphere.

All software, from the applications running on your smartphone to the training of machine learning models running in data centers, consumes electricity in its execution. One of the best ways we can reduce electricity consumption and the subsequent carbon emissions made by our software is to **make our applications more energy efficient**. 

The creators of software often do not have to bear the burden of the electricity their software consumes, this is what economists call an externality, i.e. someone else’s problem. A sustainable application takes responsibility for electricity it consumes and is architected to consume as little as possible.

Energy is a measure of an amount of electricity used, the standard unit for Energy is Joules or J however another common way of referring to energy consumption is in kilowatt-hours or kWh. Through the rest of this document we will be using kWh. 

## How do you measure electricity?

Electricity is often reported as either Power or Energy, which are two different concepts:

Energy = Power ✕ Time

*   *Energy* is the total amount of electricity used, the standard unit for Energy is Joules or J.
*   *Power* is the rate of electricity consumed per unit time, the standard unit of Energy is Watt or W. A single Watt is one Joule per second.

A common way of referring to energy consumption is _Power over a unit of Time_, such as Watt-seconds or Kilowatt-hours. For example:

*   20 Watt-seconds or 20Ws is the amount of power you would get if 20W was run for one second. Since 1 Watt is 1 Joule per second this is 20 Joules.
*   20 Kilowatt-hours or 20 kWh is the amount of energy you would get if 20,000 Watts was running for one hour. Energy = 60 ✕ 60 ✕ 20,000 = 72,000,000 Joules = 72 Megajoules = 72 MJ.
